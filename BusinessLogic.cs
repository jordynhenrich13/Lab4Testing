/**
Name: Danny Moczynski/ Jordyn Henrich
Date: 10/1/2023
Description: Lab 2, but now with a remote database
Bugs: No output for bad user error. App will not crash or add, edit, or 
delete airport - just no error prints. Have enums, but could could not get
messages to print so reverted to original.
Reflection: The Business Logic class did not change.
